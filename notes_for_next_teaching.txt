Note for me in case I teach this class again – 
The assignment “Calculating Performance Metrics” needs additional clarity around what methods (CTT vs IRT) are meant to be used and a reminder about how students should be grouped to calculate those metrics.

Also this is a good breakdown:

^^ definitely use both of these if I teach a class like this again
